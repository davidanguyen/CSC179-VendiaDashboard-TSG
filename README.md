# CSC179 - Vendia Dashboard
## Team "The Smelly Gamers"

This project was created using Angular 13. Our project goal is to create a health dashboard for our client.

**Overview**
> Create a company health dashboard that HR can use to craft preventative health policies and 
benefits. HR will also be able to use the data to negotiate a better price with insurance 
companies. 
To keep the project in scope for the summer session the focus will be on creating the dashboard 
and the ability to share selected fields of the employee health data with an insurance company.
